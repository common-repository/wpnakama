Do you have Clients, a Team, & deadlines? OR Struggling with Productivity and Transparency? Then this management tool is just meant for you.

== Description ==
WPNakama is built by a studio for studios and agencies. We know the pain of handling an agency. We need to take care of clients, work allocation, hierarchy, deadlines, files, transparency, team productivity, clarity, marketing, etc.

All of this is not just limited to digital agencies but all kinds of service businesses as law firms, accounting firms, distributors, etc. We all share the same pain points.

Unfortunately, we need to depend on hundreds of tools and give up our autonomy and of course a chunk of revenue.

**On average an agency spends $2500 USD yearly on digital tools for agency management.**

WPNakama is our attempt to bring this bill down significantly and bring productivity and transparency at the core.
